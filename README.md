This is a full-stack web application that enables a user to maintain all their family
recipes.
As a user I need to be able to:
a. View all dishes and their ingredients
b. Add a new dish to the database
c. Update dish information
d. Retrieve dishes that have a certain ingredient
e. Retrieve dishes of certain types (soup, appetizer, entr√©e, etc)
f. Retrieve a dish by its name.
g.Retrieve all dishes that are created by a certain person. (example: Grammy Sue's recipes only)
h. At the minimum, a dish should have a name, an image, a type (soup, appetizer, entree etc), who created the
recipe and a list of ingredients
